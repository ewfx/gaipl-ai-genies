hello,

till last week i was accessing bex reports using mms portal and there were no issues.

starting this week the system is incredibly slow when i log in and finally does not allow me to access any reports.

can it be the issue with any maintenance or my access rights or rather i should try to access bex using different way?

below the print screen from what i see after log in:
[cid:image001.png@01d2310c.f184b360]

i am also able to get to finance reports (see below), however when i click ""profitability analysis"" (as i was always doing) separate window is open however apart rom that the screen is blank.

hi deeghyupak,

i was on vacation when your e-mail was sent last week and only managed to see it on my return minutes before the automatically deployment.

on a general note unless there is a critical security risk deployment these updates should be limited to once a month, so far this month this is the third deployment. you may not realize the impact this has on our users especially the unannounced updates. in addition with users similarly to csr who are working directly with our customers, i do not think it is the best practice to deploy automatically updates especially to all users all at the same time.

the impact of yesterday's deployment was that our csr phones were not operating for over 2 hours during the morning.

blocking each source ip address may not necessarily be productive due to attackers' ability to switch ip addresses through the use of proxies, anonymizing software such as tor, and vpns. please investigate the targeted host to determine whether you are running a vulnerable version of the application being targeted. 

this ticket will effectively serve as a master ticket for any related alerts until we receive feedback from you on how to handle these events going forward. please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at 877. we have a number of options available for the handling of future alerts such as this one:

1) autoresolve these alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification and events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal).
2) ticket only escalation via a medium priority ticket (no phone call) for each unique source ip address for these alerts.

blocking each source ip address may not necessarily be productive due to attackers' ability to switch ip addresses through the use of proxies, anonymizing software such as tor, and vpns. please investigate the targeted host to determine whether you are running a vulnerable version of the application being targeted. 

this ticket will effectively serve as a master ticket for any related alerts until we receive feedback from you on how to handle these events going forward. please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at 877. we have a number of options available for the handling of future alerts such as this one:

1) autoresolve these alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification and events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal).
2) ticket only escalation via a medium priority ticket (no phone call) for each unique source ip address for these alerts.
3) full escalation via a high priority ticket and a phone call for each unique source ip address.

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 10.32.100.17/isensor03.company.com device generating '51793 vid36000 server response with anubis sinkhole cookies set - probable infected asset' alerts for traffic (not blocked) from port 80/tcp of 195.38.137.100 to port 3720/tcp of your lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 device indicating that the host is most likely infected with malware. 

this return traffic indicates that lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 has most likely attempted to visit a domain name which is being sinkholed. dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out false information in order to prevent the use of the domain for which ip address resolution has been requested. sinkhole traffic is a possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to a controller that has been taken over by a law enforcement or research organization as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole, however, are a clear indication of a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high priority ticket per our default escalation policies. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . 
1) ticket only escalation for sinkhole domain alerts (explicit notification via a medium priority ticket (no phone call))
2) auto-resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
secureworks soc


=========================
technical details
=========================
the domain name system (dns) is a hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or a private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on a network. 

the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains, and may delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers. the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. it defines the dns protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns, as part of the internet protocol suite.

dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted. when a client requests to resolve the address of a sinkholed hole or domain, the sinkhole returns a non-routable address or any address except for the real address. this germanytially denies the client a connection to the target host. using this method, compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs. another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for c2 (command and control) purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole are a clear indication of infection by a trojan of some sort.

connections to sinkholes may seem somewhat benign, but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent. although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they may capture from a trojan's communication, it may become public knowledge that ""company x is infected with y"", which may lead to reputational damage.

additionally, some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists, which may impede access to certain services, like sending email. finally, some trojans may connect to multiple controller domains/hostnames, and even though some of them may be sinkholed, there may be others that are not, leading to the possibility of remote code execution or information leakage to malicious parties in some cases.

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 10.32.100.17/isensor03.company.com device generating '51793 vid36000 server response with anubis sinkhole cookies set - probable infected asset' alerts for traffic (not blocked) from port 80/tcp of 195.38.137.100 to port 3720/tcp of your lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 device indicating that the host is most likely infected with malware. 

this return traffic indicates that lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 has most likely attempted to visit a domain name which is being sinkholed. dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out false information in order to prevent the use of the domain for which ip address resolution has been requested. sinkhole traffic is a possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to a controller that has been taken over by a law enforcement or research organization as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole, however, are a clear indication of a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high priority ticket per our default escalation policies. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . 
1) ticket only escalation for sinkhole domain alerts (explicit notification via a medium priority ticket (no phone call))
2) auto-resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
secureworks soc


=========================
technical details
=========================
the domain name system (dns) is a hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or a private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on a network. 

the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains, and may delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers. the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. it defines the dns protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns, as part of the internet protocol suite.

dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted. when a client requests to resolve the address of a sinkholed hole or domain, the sinkhole returns a non-routable address or any address except for the real address. this germanytially denies the client a connection to the target host. using this method, compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs. another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for c2 (command and control) purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole are a clear indication of infection by a trojan of some sort.

connections to sinkholes may seem somewhat benign, but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent. although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they may capture from a trojan's communication, it may become public knowledge that ""company x is infected with y"", which may lead to reputational damage.

additionally, some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists, which may impede access to certain services, like sending email. finally, some trojans may connect to multiple controller domains/hostnames, and even though some of them may be sinkholed, there may be others that are not, leading to the possibility of remote code execution or information leakage to malicious parties in some cases.

good day,

can you please advise whether crm is going through updates at the moment?

there are a number of issues concerning us in 1301:


1.       at the moment we cannot access crm at all.

2.       yesterday, i could not enter new customer accounts as my drop down boxes were not fully loading and thus, i could only see one or two items to select from.

3.       the team here in australia advised that lately that they have had to contact customer master on numerous occasions as there are certain entries in crm, new customer accounts, that are not transferring to erp like:
sales reps
carriers
etc

we were advised by our finance department that they believed it were aware of such problems above?

hi it,

i regularly have trouble with erp lagging, particularly it seems after 12pm our time.
last week, especially friday it was very bad all day.
yesterday and today, again it seems to lag after that 12 noon time.
this is becoming continuously embarrassing during phone calls when i am required to search for stock or quote/order over the phone as i have to apologise for the system taking so long.

there are two other csr's in the building, uisewznr ewtmkphs rarely has the same trouble (his system seems faster though), much faster than mine or duoyrpvi wgjpviul, amy's system will lag but not as much as mine.

can you please shed some light on this scenario?

note:  it is more convenient for this office if i can be contacted mid/late mornings.

hello,

the issue is that your userid is locked in erp SID_34 and in erp SID_39.
you need to go to the password_management_tool password manager and first select the option ""unlock accounts"", after that select the option ""change password""
once that is completed successfully, you should logon to distributor_tool with that new password.
